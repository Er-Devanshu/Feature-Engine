Feature engine is an alternative of Scikit-learn.
 
This is specific for Feature engineering

### 1. Focus and Purpose

| Aspect | Feature-engine | Scikit-Learn |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Main Purpose | Designed specifically for feature engineering. It offers a wide range of transformers for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, creating polynomial features, discretization, etc. | General-purpose machine learning library that includes feature engineering tools, but its primary focus is modeling and creating machine learning pipelines.|
| Target Users | Aimed at users who want to focus specifically on feature engineering and need more flexibility with feature transformations. | Ideal for users looking for an all-in-one machine learning solution with basic feature engineering tools integrated into the library. |
